I started Learning Coding since 2017 bt learing Python. I made several Demo projects like snake game, Calculator using Python.

I stared a program in Seneca College in 2022. The Program was Computer Programming. Stared with C program. Made a hospital contact list project using C program. Worked for 3 to 4 days on that project and wrote 2000 lines of code with out any error.
Linux was the first thing that I enjoyed Learing. Then SQL was really fun and easy. C++ was bit hard but the knowledge from learning C program helped me. I also learned DSA AND SOFTWARE TESTING douring the course.
Now I'm learning DevOps for last 8 months. My goal is to work as an DevOps Engineer in future. (Date-2024/05/07)
